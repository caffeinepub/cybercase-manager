  "frontend/src/pages/IncidentReportingPage.tsx": "Full incident reporting page with a form to submit new security incidents and a sortable log table; fixed all three references to the non-existent `reportTime` field, replacing them with the correct `createdAt` field from the `IncidentReport` type.",
  "frontend/src/pages/AnalyticsPage.tsx": "Analytics dashboard page with four KPI cards and three Recharts visualizations (severity pie chart, status bar chart, incident-type bar chart) all derived from live backend case and incident data, plus a severity breakdown progress-bar table — all styled in the cyberpunk neon theme.",
  "frontend/src/hooks/useQueries.ts": "Replaces all mock/incorrect API calls with real backend actor calls — `useGetMyProfile` (wraps `getMyProfile`), `useRegisterUser` (calls `registerUser`), `useGetAllUsers`, `useSetUserRole`, `useGetAllCases`, `useGetCaseById`, `useCreateCase`, `useUpdateCaseStatus`, `useDeleteCase`, `useAddCaseNote` (calls `addNoteToCase`), `useAssignCase`, `useGetAllIncidentReports`, `useReportIncident` (calls `submitIncidentReport`). All mutations invalidate relevant query caches and surface errors via toast.",
